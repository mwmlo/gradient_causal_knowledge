    "Goal: investigate the agreement between integrated gradients and activation patching when the baselines are similar, across a variety of circuit tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indirect Object Identification (Wang et al, 2023): consists of inputs like “When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a bottle of milk to”; models are expected to predict “Mary”. Performance measured using logit differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gender-Bias (Vig et al, 2020): designed to study gender bias in LMs. Gives models inputs like “The nurse said that”; biased models tend to complete this sentence with “she”. Performance measured using logit differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Greater-Than (Hanna et al., 2023): models receive input like “The war lasted from the year 1741 to the year 17”, and must predict a valid two-digit end year, i.e. one that is greater than 41. Performance measured using probability differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capital–Country (Hanna et al., 2024): models receive input like “Tirana, the capital of” and must output the corresponding country (Albania). Corrupted instances contain another capital (e.g. Brasilia) instead. Performance measured using logit differences."
